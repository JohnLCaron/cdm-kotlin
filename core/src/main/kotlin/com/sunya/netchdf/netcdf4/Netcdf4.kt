    // These attributes can occur in netCDF enhanced (netcdf-4) files beginning with version 4.4.1.
    // They all are associated with the root group as global attributes, although only _NCProperties is
    // actually stored in the file; the others are computed. They are hidden in the sense that they have
    // no attribute number, so they can only be accessed thru the netcdf-C API calls via the name.
    // Additionally, these attributes will not be counted in the number of global attributes in the root group.
    //
    // The simplest way to view these attributes is to use the -s flag to the ncdump command.
    //
    // _IsNetcdf4
    // This attribute is computed by using the HDF5 API to walk the file to look for attributes specific to netcdf-4.
    // False negatives are possible for a small subset of netcdf-4 files, especially those not containing dimensions.
    // False positives are only possible by deliberate modifications to an existing HDF5 file thru the HDF5 API.
    // For files with the _NCProperties attribute, this attribute is redundant. For files created prior to the
    // introduction of the _NCProperties attribute, this may be a useful indicator of the provenance of the file.
